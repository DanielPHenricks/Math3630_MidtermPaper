\section{Introduction}

Researchers have been studying cancer and the patterns behind tumor growth for thousands of years. Hippocrates
was accredited with possibly being the first to describe a tumor, and tumors were mainly described by their color
and their response to touch. However, ancient physicians did not separate benign and malignant tumors, but they
acknowledged the tumor's ability to infect nearby tissue. The application of mathematical models to tumor growth
did not start to gain traction until much later, however. In the early 20th century, one of the most famous uses of
the diffusion model was first developed: Hill released a paper discussing how the movement of lactic acid
and oyxgen throughout the body could be shaped into a diffusion problem (Hill, 1928). This paper eventually led to
Burton's paper which modeled the growth of tumors using diffusion, applying many of the mathematical tools employed
by Hill some years before (Burton, 1966). This paper will present a brief overview of the mathematics used in these
papers and will recreate some of the graphics produced as well.

\section{Sample Math Equation}
Let's try displaying a math equation using LaTeX:
\[
    e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
\]
This is Euler's famous equation, relating the mathematical constants $e$, $i$, $\pi$, and $0$.

\section{Lists}
LaTeX also makes it easy to create lists:

\subsection{Ordered List}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
    \item Third item
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Unordered List}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Apples
    \item Oranges
    \item Bananas
\end{itemize}
